    <h1>Interactive Projects in Scratch and MIT App Inventor</h1>
    <div class="list">
<h2>Building a Story and Game Using Scratch 3</h2>
<p>Scratch 3 is a beginner-friendly, block-based programming platform that allows users to create interactive stories, games, and animations. For this project, I developed three unique Scratch programs:

</p>
<ol>
<li><h3>Maze Game:</h3></li>
<p>In this game, I designed a maze where players navigate a sprite using arrow keys while avoiding obstacles. I implemented boundary detection and collision logic to ensure a smooth gameplay experience.</p>
<li><h3>Apple Catching Game:</h3></li> 
    <p>A fun challenge where a basket moves left and right to catch falling apples. I used loops and conditional statements to progressively increase the difficulty.</p>
<li><h3>Fun Oreo Story:</h3></li> 
    <p>An interactive storytelling project featuring animated characters, dialogues, sound effects, and animations to create an engaging Oreo-themed adventure.

<p>By working on these projects, I improved my understanding of event handling, loops, conditionals, and sprite interactions, making Scratch 3 an exciting and creative tool for learning programming.</p>
</ol>
<p>Through these projects, I gained a deeper understanding of event handling, loops, conditionals, and sprite interactions. Scratch 3 proved to be an excellent tool for learning the fundamentals of programming in a fun and creative way.</p>

<h2>Developing an Attendance App Using MIT App Inventor</h2>
<p>MIT App Inventor is a visual programming environment that simplifies mobile app development. For this project, I designed an Attendance App featuring a face camera integration to capture attendance along with date and time.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Face Camera Integration – Users can take a photo for verification.</li>
<li>Automatic Timestamp – The app records the date and time of attendance.</li>
<li>Database Storage – Attendance records are stored for future reference.</li>
<li>User-Friendly Interface – A simple "Take Attendance" button triggers the camera and displays the captured image with the timestamp.</li>

<p>Through this project, I learned how to work with device hardware integration (camera and clock components), UI design, and data storage. This experience enhanced my ability to build real-world applications using block-based programming.</p>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Completing these projects has been a valuable learning experience. Scratch 3 allowed me to experiment with game logic and animations, while MIT App Inventor introduced me to mobile app development. These projects have strengthened my problem-solving skills and expanded my knowledge of interactive programming.</p>
