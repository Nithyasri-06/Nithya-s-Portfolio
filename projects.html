        <p><strong>2.Obstacle Detection System using Arduino</strong><br><br>Developed a hardware-based Obstacle Detection System using Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), and a buzzer. The system continuously monitors its surroundings and triggers an audible alert when an obstacle is detected within a predefined range. The project demonstrates real-time distance measurement, efficient object detection, and an alert mechanism for applications in robotics, automation, and assistive devices.

        <p><strong>3.Random Number Guessing Game</strong><br><br>Build a Random Number Guessing Game which is simple simple yet engaging Java-based console application where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the number is too high or too low, and keeps track of the number of attempts. Once the correct number is guessed, the total attempts are displayed, and players can choose to replay. This project highlights fundamental Java concepts such as random number generation, loops, conditionals, and user input handling</p>

       <p><strong>4.Tic-Tac-Toe</strong><br><br>The Tic Tac Toe game is a simple yet engaging project developed in Java, featuring user input validation to prevent moves in already filled spaces. It automatically detects winning combinations and highlights them, enhancing the player's experience. Players can customize their symbols, and the game includes various animations, such as a typing effect, loading animations, and a stylish end screen. An info box provides real-time updates on game status and player turns. This project showcases the application of Java for handling game logic, user interface design, and interactive elements.
